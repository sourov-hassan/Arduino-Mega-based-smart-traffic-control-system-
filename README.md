# Arduino-Mega-based-smart-traffic-control-system-
This project implements a density-based smart traffic control system using Arduino Mega 2560. IR sensors are used to detect vehicle presence, and the system dynamically assigns green signal timing based on traffic density. LCD display and potentiometer enhance real-time monitoring and control.
